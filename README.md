### Features
+ Mesh: allows programmer to specify a polygon mesh defined in an external file
```
mesh :filename.obj
```
+ Shading

For flat shading, programmer should add this line
```
shading flat
```

For gouraud shading, programmer should add this line
```
shading gouraud
```
NOTE: 
1. It takes a while to generate images if you increase the step size for gouraud shading.
2. If the programmer doesn't add a line regarding shading, the default type of shading is flat shading.
